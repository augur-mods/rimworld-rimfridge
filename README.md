PLEASE UNINSTALL THE OLD VERSION OF RIMFRIDGE.
Even if you have it disabled, it confuses the Mod Manager and will break both mods.

Adds refrigerated racks to keep food and other perishables cold. Ideal for use in dining rooms, freeing up labour from feeding prisoners, or keeping food on hand for cooks.

Updated this mod based on my limited understanding of C#, Rimworld, and Harmony.
No guarantees are made about its reliability or functionality.
The old Readme is enclosed below, for reference.
The GitHub listed below is for 1.3, I have not yet made a repo for this 1.4 update.

Fridges currently mirror the pre-1.4 behavior and only take one stack.
Changing that to the 1.4 shelf behavior with triple stacks causes items to stick out and break the aesthetic.
If you have a neat solution in mind, let me know

DEEP STORAGE USERS:
SWM patched Deep Storage, so with the newest version of that mod and mine, you should be able to see Deep Fridges again. To guarantee you get the newest version of each mod, delete the mod files directly:

For me, the mod files are at R:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\294100.
Delete the files 1617282896 (Deep Storage) and 2878183338 (RimFridge Updated). Let Steam redownload them when you launch RimWorld, verify the game on Steam, and it should be good to go.

CURRENT ISSUES:
- The mod setting Power Factor has no effect.
